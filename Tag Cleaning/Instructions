 FULL CLEAN:
 Removes columns accuracy, views, licenceID and dates uploaded.
 Adds a few frequently occuring words to the stopwords, like geotagged or landscape.
FOR EACH ROW:
 If a row has no tags, it is set to nan.
 Each row is seen as one string so it splits it in words.
 Turns everything into lower case.
 If a word matches the machine tag format it gets removed.
 Removes punctuation and numbers.
 If a word is not nan, not a space, doesn't belong in the stopwords or is bigger than 1 letter, it is added to the clean new row.
 After cleaning the old row, if the new one has no tags it is set to nan.
 All the words in the new row are joined into one string again.
 After this procedure in all the rows of the file, a new csv file is created while the empty rows are being removed.
