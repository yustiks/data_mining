1. install pandas
2. have all 10 meta files unzipped in the same folder as files.py, left named as originally
3. have the coordinates downloaded and unzipped with added .txt at the end to the unzipped files
   please also make sure to manually get rid of the empty lines from the end of each file,
   sorry for the inconvinience :)
4. so now you should have: metadata_1.csv up to metadata_9.csv + metadata_missingBlocks.csv
   and training_latlng.txt + training_missingBlocks_latlng.txt
5. run the script, it should take around 5 minutes
6. there might be some warnings, ignore them, I checked the data, all is good.
7. all training data will be saves in train1.csv up to train10.csv
8. data for test set I send separately, it's all done - I downloaded the test set 5 - the largest one.
   let me know in case we need it for the smaller one
9. the way I've done it not all the data might be included (in case some lines are missing from the
   coordinated file in the meta files), but we don't want to use them then anyway
10. You can just copy the files from me if there's any issue
